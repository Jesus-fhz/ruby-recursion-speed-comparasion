# Simple speed testing in Ruby Using recursivity


## About:
Testing the speed of recursivity  in ruby, Examples used: a simple countdown and fibonacci.

Countdown example: How many iterations per second and how many in 10 seconds, using a time loop vs recursivity

Fibonnaci example: How many iterations per second and how many in 10 seconds, and 32 as fib secuence.
-Using a while loop
-Using recursivity
-Recursivity using memoization with an array
-Recursivity using memoization with a hash
